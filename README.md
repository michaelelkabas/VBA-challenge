# VBA Stock Analysis
The StockAnalysis VBA subroutine is designed to loop through all the stocks for one year and outputs the ticker symbol, Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. Lastly, the total volume also aggregates the total stock volume of each stock. 

Tracking Greatest Changes and Volume
Greatest % Increase: Identifies the stock with the highest percentage increase.
Greatest % Decrease: Identifies the stock with the highest percentage decrease.
Greatest Total Volume: Identifies the stock with the highest total volume.

Output
Summary Tables: Outputs the analysis results, including ticker symbols, yearly changes, percentage changes, and total volumes, into summary tables in each worksheet.
Greatest Changes and Volume: Outputs the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume into specified cells in each worksheet.

Conditional formatting is used to color the cells in the Yearly change column that are negative in red, and those that are positive integers as green.
